# Hello and welcome to me


This is a place where I'm dumping a lot of work from various random things I've been working on for the last few years. Why not use GitHub for the free version control and cloud storage?!

I might put anything from university MatLab scripts I want to keep to a website that helps deck building for Mythos Rising to my 2021 project of making an AI to play Century Spice Road.

Enjoy
